Example Summary
----------------
Application that uses the UART driver and LoggerIdle to send Log data to the
UART.

Peripherals Exercised
---------------------
Board_LED0      Indicates that the board was initialized within main()
Board_UART0     Used to data to System Analyzer

Please refer to the Getting Started Guide's Board section to get details
regarding the location of the buttons, LEDs, USB connections and any
additional settings (e.g. jumpers) for your specific board.

Example Usage
-------------
Run the example. Board_LED0 turns ON to indicate TI-RTOS driver
initialization is complete.

This example also demonstrates System Analyzer in CCS. This is accomplished
via sending log records via UART from the target to the host. Please refer to
TI-RTOS User Guide's for more details.

The UART uses the default 9600 baud rate.

Application Design Details
--------------------------
This example demonstrates how to use an application to send Log data through a
UART. Log data will go through Board_UART0 which is connected to your PC
through the same USB as the JTAG.  Log events will be sent during idle through
Board_UART0 and can be analyzed by System Analyzer, or the data can be captured
by a program running on the host. Your host program for collecting the Log data
will need to use the serial COM port that is connected to Board_UART0.
