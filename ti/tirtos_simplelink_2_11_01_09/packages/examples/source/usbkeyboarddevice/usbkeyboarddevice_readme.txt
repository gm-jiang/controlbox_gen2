regarding the location of the buttons, LEDs, USB connections and any
additional settings (e.g. jumpers) for your specific board.

Example Usage
-------------
Run the example. Board_LED0 turns ON to indicate TI-RTOS driver
initialization is complete.

Once the enumeration occurs, Board_LED0 and Board_LED1 show the status
of Caps Lock and Scroll lock respectively. For example, press Caps Lock
on your keyboard and Board_LED0 will toggle.

Board_BUTTON0 simulates the typing of the following string:

   "TI-RTOS controls USB.\n"

An easy way to see this is to open an empty text file in edit mode and press
Board_BUTTON0. The text will be "typed" in.
