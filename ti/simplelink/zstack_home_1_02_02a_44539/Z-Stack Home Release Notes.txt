Version 1.2.2a
October 16, 2015


Notices:
 - Z-Stack Home 1.2.2a meets requirements for full conformance to the ZigBee
   Home Automation 1.2 specification. The Z-Stack Home 1.2.2a release is based
   on Z-Stack Core 2.6.3a - see the "Z-Stack Core Release Notes" for details.

 - Z-Stack Home provides over 15 documents that cover various aspects of this
   Home Automation development package. Included is API documentation for each
   layer of the Z-Stack system, and a selection of Developer's Guides, User's
   Guides, and Application Notes to accelerate your product development. These
   documents can be found at: <InstallPath>\Documents folder with the default
   set to: "C:\Texas Instruments\Z-Stack Home 1.2.2.44539\Documents" which can
   be accessed from the Windows Start Menu.

 - Z-Stack for the CC2630/CC2650 has been built/tested with IAR's DLIB library.

 - Z-Stack projects specify compile options in two ways: (1) "-D" statements
   in f8wConfig.cfg and other *.cfg files, (2) entries in the IDE Compiler
   Preprocessor Defined Symbols. When using the EWARM compiler, settings in
   the *.cfg files will override any made in the IDE.

 - When programming devices for the first time with this release, the entire
   Flash memory should be erased: select "Project->Download->Erase Memory".

 - Application, library, and hex files were built/tested with the following
   versions of IAR tools and may not work with different IAR tool versions:
     - CC2630 + SRF06EB:  EWARM 7.40.2  (7.40.2.8570)
     - CC2630 + EXP5438:  EW430 6.20.1  (6.20.1.931)

 - Support software packages for Z-Stack Home 1.2.2a on CC2630/CC2650 include:
     - TI-RTOS:  tirtos_simplelink_2_11_01_09
     - XDCTOOLS: xdctools_3_30_06_67_core


Changes:
 - [6021] Seven new Monitor-Test commands have been added to support extended
   capabilities of the Non-Volatile memory system (NV) on the CC2630/CC2650
   platforms. Refer to sections 3.8.1.27-3.8.1.33 of the "Z-Stack Monitor and
   Test API" document for details.

 - [5893] Introduces the Boundary tool that automatically optimizes the Code
   and RAM memory boundaries between core stack and application images. This
   tool analyzes the Code and RAM requirements for the Z-Stack Core image and
   optimizes the compiler/linker boundaries to maximize memory spaces for the
   Application image. The Boundary tool only makes changes to the boundary
   files when the Z-Stack Core is altered

 - [5844] Modified the ZCL EZ-Mode to support the ZCL_STANDALONE compile flag.

 - [5747] Introduces support for the CC2630/CC2650, running on TI-RTOS. The
   sample applications for Home Automation are built from two separate images,
   the Z-Stack Core and the HA Application. Refer to the "Z-Stack Home TI-RTOS
   Developer's Guide" and the "Z-Stack Home Sample Application User's Guide"
   for details on working with the Home Automation sample applications. The
   ZigBee Network Processor (ZNP) devices are built from a single image, and
   therefore do not involve use of the Boundary tool.


Bug Fixes:
 - [6193] Fixed an issue where an EZ-Mode target would stop waiting for any
   Identify Query Responses when the first response was received.

 - [6124] Fixed a problem in EZ-Mode commissioning where binding information
   was not being saved in non-volatile memory when NV_RESTORE was enabled.

 - [5918] Fixed the device ID in the simple descriptor for the following three
   sample applications - they previously indicated 'Dimmable Light':
     - Door Lock
     - Door Lock Controller
     - Temperature Sensor

 - [5839] Added rejoin back off capability to force the HA device to wait for
   a specified amount of time after attempting to rejoin before attempting to
   rejoin again, unless prompted by user intervention. The back off timer and
   scan duration can now be set at compile or run time. Default values for both
   timers is set at 15 minutes, per section 5.3.2 of the HA 1.2 spec.


Known Issues:
 - Home Automation sample applications only support ZigBee End-Devices.

 - ZNP applications and hex files only support a single ZigBee device type.

 - ZNP currently supports UART only, SPI will be added in a future release.

 - UART I/O does not support flow control, will be added in a future release.

 - The ZAP sample applications retain the older format (from the Home-1.1.1
   release), so they do not provide EZ-Mode commissioning.

 - To disable security at build time, use the "SECURE=0" compile option in the
   Z-Stack Core image. Don't try to disable security by setting SECURITY_LEVEL
   to zero.

 - The ZDO Complex Descriptor is not supported.
